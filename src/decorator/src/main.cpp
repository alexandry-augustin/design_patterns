//The Decorator attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
//The ornaments that are added to pine or fir trees are examples of Decorators.
//Lights, garland, candy canes, glass ornaments, etc.,
//can be added to a tree to give it a festive look.
//The ornaments do not change the tree itself which is recognizable as a Christmas tree
//regardless of particular ornaments used.

//Note that this pattern allows responsibilities to be added to an object, not methods to an objectâ€™s interface.
//The interface presented to the client must remain constant as successive layers are specified.
